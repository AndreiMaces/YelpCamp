## Why I created it?
I watched a udemy coursed named [”The Web Developer Bootcamp”](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=WebDevelopment_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROWMTA-B_ti.8322&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_80869579591_._ad_533999956732_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930035449_._li_20899_._pd__._&matchtype=) and I was instructed step by step in how to create this application.
## How long before it was done?
The completion of the entire course took me about 3 months and after watching it I acumulated knowledge about the way a server works, 
what is a web application, what front-end and back-end is about, what are databases, what is a web session and why we are getting those
cookie modules permission requests each time we open social media apps like Facebook.
I've been instructed in cyber security concepts like Sql injection, cross-site scripting, mongo injection and cookie stealing
and how important it is that I make apps that are not vulnerable to those types of attacks.
## What is this application all about?
It is a platform which shows us a variety of camping places all around the world.
The clients can interact with it through comments and reviews and they can add new camping places as well. 
There is also a authentication system implemented with passport library.
